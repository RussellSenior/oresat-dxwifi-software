# oresat-dxwifi-software
Software and firmware used on the "DxWiFi" OreSat satellite system that will broadcast 2.4 GHz WiFi video.

This repo is for the software and firmware that will fly on the OreSate satellite, specically an Octavo A8 IC running linux attached to a Atheros 9271 USB to WiFi IC. See the other repos if you're interested in the OreSat Live handheld ground station or the Mini-OreSat balloon system.
