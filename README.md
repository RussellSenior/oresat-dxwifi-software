# oresat-dxwifi-software
Software and firmware used on the OreSat satellite system that will transmit bulk science mission data on S-Band. Also used for the 2.4 GHz _DxWiFi video experiment_.

This is software for the **satellite** only; please see the other repos if you're looking for the [OreSat Live Handheld Ground Station](https://github.com/oresat/oresat-live-handheld-ground-station) or the [Mini-OreSat testing platform for high altitude balloons](https://github.com/oresat/oresat-live-mini-oresat).

Current plan is for the software to operate on an Octavo SoC with a Cortex A8 running Linux, attached to a Atheros 9271 USB to WiFi IC running possibly custom firmware.
